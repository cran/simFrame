Changes in simFrame version 0.2

    + Argument 'average' added to plot function 'simXyplot' that specifies 
      whether the mean or median is used to compute averages.
    
    + replaced example data, which is now called 'eusilcP' and has household 
      income components.
    
    + added accessor and mutator functions 'getFoo' and 'setFoo' for slots 
      (here "foo" stands for the name of the slot). If no method 'setFoo' is 
      available, this means that the slot is not supposed to be changed by the 
      user.
    
    + renamed slots "group" to "grouping" and "method" to "fun" (where 
      available) since functions named 'getGroup', 'getMethod' and 'setMethod' 
      already exist and cannot be used for accessor and mutator functions, 
      respectively.
    
    + renamed function 'getProb' to 'inclusionProb' to allow accessor method 
      for slot "prob".
    
    + removed class "SimResult" to avoid confusion.
    
    + added 'show' methods and improved existing ones.
    
    + added 'summary', 'head' and 'tail' methods.
    
    + restructured help.
    
    + added demos for design-based simulation, model-based simulation and 
      parallel computing.
    
    + classes "SampleControl" and "SampleSetup" now contain a slot that 
      indicates whether groups are collected after sampling individuals or 
      sampled directly.
    
    + class "SampleSetup" now contains a slot that stores the seed of the 
      random number generator before and after setting up the samples.
    
    + made various improvements for plot functions if simulation results with 
      multiple contamination levels or missing value rates are supplied.




Changes in simFrame version 0.1.2

    + Class "NAControl" now contains a slot that specifies whether missing 
      values should also be inserted into contaminated observations.
    
    + Added 'aggregate' method for objects of class "SimResults".
    
    + In function 'contaminate', the column ".contaminated" is always appended, 
      even if 'epsilon' is 0 or 'x' does not have any rows. 


Changes in simFrame version 0.1.1

    + Argument 'select' added to plot functions for specifying columns to be 
      plotted.
    
    + Row names of example data 'eusilc' are now sorted from 1 to the number of 
      rows.
    
    + Fixed cross-references in some help files.
